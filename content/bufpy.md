I gave a presentation to the Buffalo Python meetup group in December. My talk centered around using the Raspberry Pi as a platform for IoT and embedded development. I want to share my presentation and the resources I mentioned here on my blog.

My presentation:

Resources I mentioned (and some more):

* The [Raspberry Pi home page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
* [OS downloads](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/), including Raspbian and more
* [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), for copying OS images to an SD card
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.headmelted.com/) for the Raspberry Pi
* [Pi Wheels](www.piwheels.org) precompiled python libraries
* [PiCamera](https://picamera.readthedocs.io) docs
* My [PiLit Christmas light controller](https://github.com/skypanther/PiLit) project
* The [PyImageSearch blog](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/), and the [motion detection / tracking post](www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/) (and its [second part](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/01/home-surveillance-and-motion-detection-with-the-raspberry-pi-python-and-opencv/))
* The [Official Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide](https://store.rpipress.cc/products/the-official-raspberry-pi-beginner-s-guide) looks to be a good starter book for younger RPi tinkerers.
