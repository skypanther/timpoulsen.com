A dump of ideas taken from conversations in RocDev and elsewhere:
Use a good mic for conference calls, so that everyone can be heard. And consistently use it.
If you have quiet-talkers / mumblers, people in the room need to tell them to speak up. Or, have someone else repeat it.
If you're the organizer or sitting closest to the mic, use the good presenter technique of repeating questions so that those on the call can hear.
Avoid "hallway meetings" as a way of making decisions. And when that happens, make sure to inform your remote employee. Try to work in ways to include the remote employee (call them, quick grab a conf room and start a video chat, etc.)
Document decisions, take & share meeting minutes
Use good video conferencing software and make sure your network connection is good to avoid jerkiness, drop outs, modulation, etc. Make sure background noise is at a minimum.
Regularly check in with your remote employee to make sure he/she knows what tasks she's assigned, to make sure she hasn't hit roadblocks, etc.
Send remotes snacks
If the office gets together for beers/dinner, do something nice for the remotes (send them a dinner gift certificate)
Avoid on-sites that are after work hours and drinking oriented if you’re dealing with “near remotes” (can drive to the office in a couple of hours)
Avoid teams where only one person is remote
Conduct all meetings as if everyone is remote. Try to not all gather in one room (meet from your desks)
set up a watercool chat mechanism and use it
whatever you use for video conferencing, use it consistently. I worked at one place where it was random, sometimes slack calls, sometimes Hangouts, sometimes Zoom, sometimes whatever freebie service the organizer had discovered someplace.
Practice good video conference hygiene — avoid stray noises, background conversations, mute yourself when not talking, let the remote person get a word in, ask them if they have input/questions. And for blessed sake, figure out connectivity and tech ahead of time so that not every call begins with “can you hear me?” and fumbling to get sound/video working. If a meeting must start late or early, make sure to let the remote folks know (and why). 
Start meetings on time. Whether you’re onsite or remote, show up on time.
