## Second in series

I'll cover wiring, connecting to your microcontroller, and show a basic sketch for displaying some colorful blinkies.

## Third in series

I'm planning a third post in the series to cover the libraries -- FastLED in particular -- commonly used with pixels.

pixels - could be multiple posts

- basic arduino/esp schematic
- basic FastLED sketch

FastLED (could be separate post)

- libraries & projects, like WLED
- fading between colors
- fading to black
- built in color constants
- built in functions (set-all-to-color)

Syntax highlighting with & without line numbers

    :::python
    print("The triple-colon syntax will *not* show line numbers.")

To display line numbers, use a path-less shebang instead of colons:

    #!python
    print("The path-less shebang syntax *will* show line numbers.")

    #!javascript
    sample code block

Include font-awesome symbols like this
<i class="fa fa-heart red"></i>
