# Adding a third brake light to a 6-volt, positive ground electrical system

Adding a third brake light to my 1940 Chevrolet with its 6-volt, positive ground system, was challenging but ultimately successful.

Diagram included, needs to be updated for positive ground, and to match what actually went in. I have photos of the finished wiring, pre and post wrapping up neatly.

Cover the 3D printing, link to STL, and the LED strip I used.

first paragraph

Syntax highlighting with & without line numbers

    :::python
    print("The triple-colon syntax will *not* show line numbers.")

To display line numbers, use a path-less shebang instead of colons:

    #!python
    print("The path-less shebang syntax *will* show line numbers.")

    #!javascript
    sample code block

Include font-awesome symbols like this
