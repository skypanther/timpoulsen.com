This is a recap of the presentation I gave to the Otters (Early Career) Cohort on 2022-09-26.

Asking for help can be a daunting challenge. Will people think I‚Äôm dumb for not knowing the answer? Am I bugging them too much? Maybe if I keep digging, I‚Äôll find the answer on my own. Wouldn‚Äôt a real developer already know the answer?

There is no precise formula to determine when to ask for help. It depends. But there are some guidelines which I‚Äôll share in this post. 

First, let‚Äôs break down the types of help you might need.
Ticket / Product questions

Are the ticket requirements unclear? Are you missing info about the change being requested? Do you think there are prerequisites that are missing? These types of questions are probably best handled by asking straight away.

Your product manager is your primary resource for these types of questions. But your tech lead and EM are are also there to help with these sorts of questions.
Organizational Questions

Who does X? Who can I ask about Y? Tackle is growing so fast, I don‚Äôt think anyone can keep up. There is the org chart in Paylocity. There was a hackathon project to creating a sort of social site for Tacklers. So you could try those first. But really, just ask. Ask your team, in a shared channel like #dev, or ask your manager.
Career, Benefits, and HR-type Questions

I‚Äôll throw all the questions about expenses, benefits, job openings, career growth suggestions, etc. into this bucket. A lot of your questions can be answered by the excellent info on the Tackle Intranet (aka Tacklenet). But don‚Äôt be afraid to ask your manager. They‚Äôre here for you.
On-call Questions

If you‚Äôre on-call:

    Look to the Tackle Domain Inventory spreadsheet to determine which pod is responsible for that domain

    Post to that team‚Äôs pod channel. You can find a list of those channels on the Pod Spaces page in Confluence

Technical Questions

Okay, this is probably why you read this blog post. Before you ask for help, you should do your best to find the answer on your own. Some suggestions on how to do so:

    Read the docs ‚Äî Tackle docs, code comments, library documentation, etc.

    Search Slack ‚Äì maybe this problem has been encountered before and the solution is waiting for you in our chat archives

    Search - Google, StackOverflow (a topic for a future blog post)

    Rubber ducking ‚Äî pretend you‚Äôre asking a colleague. Or, pretend you‚Äôre explaining the solution, feature, or new functionality. Often formulating the question to ask will help you see the path to the solution.

    Have you asked the question before? Did you take notes? If so, review them. If you didn‚Äôt take notes, why not? But if that‚Äôs the case, and you‚Äôve done the above steps, go ahead and ask. But this time, take notes!

    Do you have an idea and you‚Äôre looking for a second opinion?

        What are the implications of getting it wrong? If the worst that can happen is you get requests for changes on your PR, give it a stab and try anyway. You might be just over-worrying. If a mistake could lead to significant monetary or customer risk, like if there‚Äôs really a ‚Äúwrong‚Äù way to do something, asking for input is fine.

        Would it take a long time to implement your solution? It‚Äôs probably best to ask for input before you put in a lot of work that might have to be thrown away if it was the wrong approach.

    Has there been some back-and-forth on your PR? Has it been sitting unreviewed for a long time? In these cases, a synchronous, ‚Äúin person‚Äù session is needed to get things done. Ask your team for a PR party. Pick a time, open a zoom, and go through the PR together.

When should you ask

I suggest you set a time limit on your research ‚Äì time-box it, then ask. Try for a while, but don‚Äôt dig forever. The exact time you should research on your own varies by the situation. The following is a very-rough, completely unsupported, made-up off the top of my head rubric:

For example, if you‚Äôre working on a ticket that should take roughly a week, putting in a day or two of research into the solution you need is probably a good investment.
Who should you ask

You should ask publicly, not by direct message. There are a few reasons for this:

    The person you‚Äôre going to ask is busy with their own workload. Your question, even though ‚Äúquick‚Äù will disrupt their work, take them out of their zone. 

    By asking the group, you benefit from all the experience and knowledge of that whole group. Maybe the person you were going to ask doesn‚Äôt know the answer, or has incomplete information?

    Your question in the open, and the follow-up discussion, forms a loose type of documentation. Even better, it can highlight the need for better formal documentation.

So, kinda-sorta in this order:

    Ask in your pod‚Äôs channel

    Ask in your super-pod‚Äôs channel

    Ask in #dev

    Ask in one of the language-specific channels (#python) or guild channels (#guild-observability)

    Still stuck‚Ä¶okay, ask your tech lead‚Ä¶or engineering manager.

    Still really stuck, like you‚Äôve literally tried everything else, okay, DM someone.

How should you ask

You want to let people know you tried to find the answer. If you think you might have an answer, and are looking for supporting evidence, make sure to share what you think is the right answer. You should make sure to give them enough context so they know why you need an answer. If it‚Äôs time-sensitive, make sure they know that too.

And oh yeah, be succinct. Because everyone is busy (and people don‚Äôt read üòè).

Finally, be gracious ‚Äì whether you get an answer or not.
