This Code Is Crap

Code represents the sum of:

    the acceptance criteria, goals, and deadlines that inspired the code to be written.

    the knowledge of the problem domain at the time it was written.

    the balance between Done & Good-enough appropriate at the time it was written.

    the knowledge and skill of the author.

    the knowledge, skill, attention, and diligence of the reviewers.

Ultimately, code reflects the team of people who specified it, wrote it, reviewed it, and tested it. Attacking code is attacking people, many of whom may still be your fellow employees.

So, don’t say “this code is crap.” Instead, say given what we know now, given the people we have to work on it, and the time we have to work on it now, let’s make it better.
